     <h1>What is Poha?</h1>
     <p>
        The word "Poha" (plural pohe) refers to two distinct things: the ingredient, which is flattened rice, and the dish made from this ingredient.

Poha are flattened rice flakes, also known as beaten rice. It is made by de-husking rice grains and parboiling them. They are then dried, roasted, and flattened with iron rollers.  </p>
